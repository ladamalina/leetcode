# 1450. Number of Students Doing Homework at a Given Time

Given two integer arrays startTime and endTime and given an integer queryTime.

The ith student started doing their homework at the time startTime[i] and finished it at time endTime[i].

Return the number of students doing their homework at time queryTime. More formally, return the number of students where queryTime lays in the interval [startTime[i], endTime[i]] inclusive.

Constraints:

* startTime.length == endTime.length
* 1 <= startTime.length <= 100
* 1 <= startTime[i] <= endTime[i] <= 1000
* 1 <= queryTime <= 1000

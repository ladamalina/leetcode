# 1309. Decrypt String from Alphabet to Integer Mapping

Given a string s formed by digits ('0' - '9') and '#' . We want to map s to English lowercase characters as follows:

* Characters ('a' to 'i') are represented by ('1' to '9') respectively.
* Characters ('j' to 'z') are represented by ('10#' to '26#') respectively.

Return the string formed after mapping.

It's guaranteed that a unique mapping will always exist.

# 1286. Iterator for Combination

Design an Iterator class, which has:

* A constructor that takes a string characters of sorted distinct lowercase English letters and a number combinationLength as arguments.
* A function next() that returns the next combination of length combinationLength in lexicographical order.
* A function hasNext() that returns True if and only if there exists a next combination.

Constraints:

* 1 <= combinationLength <= characters.length <= 15
* There will be at most 10^4 function calls per test.
* It's guaranteed that all calls of the function next are valid.

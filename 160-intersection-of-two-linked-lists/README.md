# 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

Notes:

* If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
* The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
* You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
* Each value on each linked list is in the range [1, 10^9].
* Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.
